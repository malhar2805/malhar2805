### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ 

My Name is Malhar Shah and I am a freshman studying Computer Science at the University of Waterloo. I love everything about food and chess!

I am currently an ambitious coder and have been coding for about ~2 years now. I am comfortable working in Python, C, and Javascript, specializing in the MERN stack.

My real strengths are in the AI department. I have ample experience in popular AI tools such as Tensorflow 2.0, Open CV, and Cohere API, creating multiple classification and regression models. Whenever I'm not coding and trying out new projects on my Arduino, I can be found outside playing basketball, working out at my community centre, and playing chess as a 1600-rated player!

I have attended multiple hackathons including Hack the North and UofT Hacks where my team and I created Orthios and Ripple respectively, networking with many professionals along the way. I am particularly interested in Data Science and Machine Learning, essentially anything that resembles Chat GPT.

I appreciate the time you took to read my page so, as a return gift, here is a Fun Fact!

:zap: The word "Checkmate" in Chess comes from the Persian phrase "Shah Mat," which means "the King is dead."
