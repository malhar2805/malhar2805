### Hey there ðŸ‘‹ (yes you, the one infront of the screen)

My Name is Malhar Shah and I am a soon to be freshman at the University of Waterloo for a Bachleor in Computer Science. I love everything about food and chess!

I am currenlty a novice coder and have been coding for about ~2 years now (as seen by my horrendous stats :sweat:). I am comfortable working in python :snake: and enough C++ to be able to use Ardino (which is not much I'm afraid.)

[![Malhar's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=malhar2805)](https://github.com/malhar2805/github-readme-stats)

My real strenghts are in the hardware side of computer engineering, such as Breadboards, Arduino, Raspberry Pi, Microbit, and any other device that breaches software and hardware together. 
Whenever I'm not coding and trying out new projects on my Arudino, I can be found outside playing basketball, working out in my home gym, and playing chess as a 1600 rated player!

I just recently attended Hack the North hosted by University of Waterloo. My freinds and I built a project called Orthios that corrects your posture by sending a notfication to your phone!

I appreaciate the time you took to read my page so, as a return gift, here is a Fun Fact!

:zap: The word "Checkmate" in Chess comes from the Persian phrase "Shah Mat," which means "the King is dead."
